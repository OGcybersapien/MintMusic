    <string name="mainActivityUsage">This is the Main Activity for the app. In my design, this app is a music streaming service, like Saavn.\n\tWhile in online mode, this activity will show the current trending Songs and albums. \n\tIn offline mode, this activity will show the user\'s saved(downloaded/cached) songs list, as well as any playlists created by the user\n\tBelow are the buttons which will take us to different activities, From here, we need access to the Now Playing Screen, the playlist detail screen, and the my account screen</string>
    <string name="title_activity_now_playing">Now Playing</string>
    <string name="nowPlayingDetail">This screen is for the now playing section of the app. We will have an album art on top, over which there will be the name of the currently playing song and the artist, with a semi-transparent background. In the lower half of the screen, we can display the current play queue. (This will require the use of Fragments and databases to store the playing queue when the app is closed.) On long clicking a song in the queue, the app will open the song details screen, meeting the project rubric, for now, I\'m only making a button to go to the Song details screen. On the titleBar(ActionBar) we need a back button to go back to the main screen. For the music to keep playing in the background even when the app is not in focus/screen, we will need to implement a background service.</string>
